TODO is TODO
-----------------
This project started with normal jdk crate to remove repetead installation of java after machine crash, or 
new os installation or new machine or when new progs are hired at your company.

The crate scripts need to be made intuitive and easier to work with gradually with time.

It will soon be a separate project under name `programmer-mattress` submoduled here on `dotfiles`.
